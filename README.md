Family-Planning
===============
i have started this project to help families with teenagers who are struggling to find their independence

alot of families find it difficult to handle their child becomming increasingly independant and their plans very often may clash

this app will resolve that

the idea is that you can log in and add a family members user to your calender

that family member can then add events you your schedule - emilinating the need to ask if you will be free at a certian time

by adding members of the family to your calender it will mean that they are able to view your calender and plan their day/week
around the plans you have already made, so no more "oh, but i've already--------"   you get the idea :)

this will be implemented in the following stages:

1. create a login system - done
2. create a personal schedule which will be saved online
3. add in editing of individual events in the schedule which will include deleting
4. add in reccuring events
5. create a "friend" list to let other users view your calender
6. add the ability to create events for users who have you on their "friend" list

7. add push notifications for new events added by family
8. add the option for an alarm to go off 1hour - 1 day before a scheduled event
9. add a window to display graphically the amount of time assigned to individual tasks
